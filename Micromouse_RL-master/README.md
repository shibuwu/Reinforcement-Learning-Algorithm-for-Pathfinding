Navigating in unknown real world is a key challenge in autonomous vehicle or mobile robot application.  In this project, the problem is simplified as a robot navigating in an unknown maze and finding its optimal path.

The scope of the project is to develop a motion planning algorithm that enables a robot to explore an unknown maze (environment), to learn the maze layout, and then to find its fastest path from a corner of the maze to its center.  

#### Method

Used Reinforcement Learning to learn an unknown maze and to find its the fastest path.
